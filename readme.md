# Kibana Field Formatter Plugin Examples

2 for the price of 1.

## 1. Dictionary Lookup

Converts an integer to a descption based on a dictionary lookup.

Includes a single dictionary:
- IP Protocol numbers to text-description. Useful for Flow Logs

Example: `6` => `TCP`

## 2. Nicely Formatted Floats

Converts an ugly number EG `0.0059` into `5.9 ms` showing units and a reasonable level of precesion. Useful for big dashboards, where you need a simple-looking number with appropriate units.

Includes the following:
- SI Units (seconds, grams, meters & cake)
- Fractional prefixes
  - mili, micro, nano, pico
- Multiplier prefixes
  - kilo, mega, giga, tera
- Ability to control the precision required:
  - Significant digitis (fixed and optional)
  - Decimal Places (fixed and optional)

Bugs:
- Some combination of settings will show javascript scientific notation `1e+3 Âµs` due to `Math.toFixed` & `Math.toPrecision` being uncontrollable. I didn't want to rely upon heafty 3rd-party libraries.
